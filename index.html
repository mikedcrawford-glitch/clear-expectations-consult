    <h1>Clear Expectations Consult</h1>
    <p>
      You deserve honest answers before — and after — surgery.
      This service offers private, one-on-one conversations to help you
      understand what recovery can really be like, set realistic expectations,
      and feel less alone in the process.
    </p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Important:</strong> This is not medical advice.</p>

      <h2>About Debbie</h2>
      <p>
        Debbie isn’t a doctor — and that’s the point.
        She has lived experience with cosmetic body procedures and learned firsthand
        that recovery can be harder than expected, emotions can shift,
        and results don’t always match the sales pitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a calm, honest space to talk through expectations,
        recovery experiences, and emotional challenges with someone who truly understands.
      </p>

      <h2>Who This Is For</h2>
      <p>
        This service is for people considering cosmetic surgery
        or those who are post-surgery and struggling emotionally.
        It is not medical advice, not therapy, and not a replacement
        for professional care.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What to Expect</h2>
      <p>
        Sessions are private, confidential, and conversation-based.
        There is no pressure, no sales pitch, and no promises —
        just honest discussion and support.
      </p>
    </div>

    <footer>
      Clear Expectations Consult provides peer-based, experience-driven support only.
      No medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment is provided.
